RXSwift-Class-Demos
===
These playgrounds were used in class demos teaching the basic priniciple of reactive programming for Swift in 67-447 F18.  These playgrounds draw heavily from the book [RxSwift: Reactive Programming with Swift v2.0](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/rxswift-reactive-programming-with-swift) by Pillet, et al. I strongly recommend students interested in learning more about reactive programming buy the book, as there is a lot of material covered in the book that we cannot hope to cover in a single week.

Be aware that I could not get the code examples provided to work (kept getting a "error: Couldn't lookup symbols" message, so I rebuilt these from scratch and added some additional annotation and some modifications).  I'm not sure if the issue is due to the transition to iOS 12 (this was written from the previous version of iOS) or some other issue, but I didn't get these to work. In order to get a playground to allow for the use of Cocoapods, I had to create them within a Xcode workspace, following the directions found at [https://learnappmaking.com/cocoapods-playground-how-to/](https://learnappmaking.com/cocoapods-playground-how-to/). Hopefully students using these playgrounds will not encounter the same frustration of them not working as I had with the original material.
